# SemesterProject

TestAgent and StepAgent generate the ABM data neccessary for the project.

For the implementation of TGAN and SINDy - prexsisting codebases were utilized. Specifically Y-data-synthetic and pySindy respectively. 
For that reason we only provide the basic scripts here and not the total codebase.
